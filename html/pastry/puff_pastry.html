                <ul>
                
                
                    <li>Measure all but 1/2 cup of flour into a mixing bowl.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Cut in the 1/4 cup of chilled butter with a pastry blender until it resembled course crumbs.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Add the salt and water and mix gently until a rough dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If necessary, add more water 1 tbsp at a time until the dough comes together.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Form the dough into a 9 inch square, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Place the remaining 1 3/4 cups butter and 1/2 cup flour in a food processor and blend together (or use a wooden spoon and blend by hand).</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Form the butter into an 8 inch square on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper, cover it with a second sheet, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it into a 12 inch square on a lightly floured surface.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Place the chilled butter in the center, and fold the corners of the dough over the butter until it meets in the middle. Seal the dough over the butter.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Turn the square over and gently roll it into a 20 by 10 inch rectangle. Make sure your surface is well dusted with flour.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Brush off any excess flour, and fold the dough into thirds.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>If the dough is still cold, repeat the rolling and folding. If not, wrap it in plastic and chill it for 15 minutes and then proceed to the second turn.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Repeat the process of chilling and folding the dough until your have made six turns.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>Refrigerate at least an hour before using.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>To use, roll half the dough and trim the edges before forming as desired.</li>
                
                
                
                    <li>For croissants, bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
