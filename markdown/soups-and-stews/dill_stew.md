## Recipe: Dill Stew with Rosemary Dumplings


### Ingredients
 - 3 tbsp olive oil
 - 1/4 cup flour
 - 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 3 cloves garlic, minced
 - 6 cups vegetable broth
 - 2 stalks celery, sliced
 - 1 1/2 lbs potatoes (~2 russet) diced
 - 2 carrots, sliced
 - 1 tsp dry thyme (or 1 tbsp fresh)
 - 2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
 - 1/2 teaspoon paprika
 - Fresh black pepper
 - 1 15oz can navy beans, drained
 - 1 batch soup dumplings (see recipe)

### Steps
 - Make a roux - heat olive oil in a large, heavy pan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle in flour, mixing constantly, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
 - Add onion and salt, and toss to coat the onions. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add garlic and stir for another 30 seconds.
 - Pour in broth, whisking constantly to avoid clumping.
 - Add vegetables, dill, thyme, and paprika. Increase heat and cover, bringing it to a boil. Stir occasionally to avoid boiling over or sticking.
 - Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until stew is thick and potatoes and carrots are tender.
 - In the meantime, prepare the dumplings.
 - Once the stew is ready, add navy beans, and plop balls of dumpling dough into the stew. Cover the pot and cook for another 10-15 minutes. Dumplings should be firm.
