## Recipe: Grapefruit Curd
Quantity: About 16 oz  

### Ingredients
 - 1 cup fresh grapefruit juice (about 2 grapefruits)
 - 2 tbsp lemon juice
 - 3 tsp finely grated grapefruit zest
 - 1/2 cup sugar
 - 3 eggs
 - 6 tbsp unsalted butter
 - 1/4 tsp salt

### Steps
 - Juice the grapefruits and reduce the juice by about half.
 - Allow the juice to cool back to around room temperature.
 - In a saucepan, boil water. Place a heat-proof mixing bowl over the water, and whisk together the juices, zest, sugar, and eggs.
 - Stir in butter and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of the whisk and bubbles appear on the surface, about 6 minutes.
 - Whisk in the salt.
 - Chill for at least an hour before using.
