## Recipe: Lemon Curd
Quantity: About 16 oz  

### Ingredients
 - 2 tsp finely grated lemon zest
 - 1/2 cup sugar
 - 1 tablespoon small pearl tapioca
 - 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (probably 2-3 lemons)
 - 6 tbsp unsalted vegan butter

### Steps
 - Add the zest, sugar, and tapioca to the bowl of a food processor and process until the tapioca is reduced to sandy powder.
 - In a saucepan, boil water. Place a heat-proof mixing bowl over the water, and whisk together zest mixture and lemon juice.
 - Stir in the vegan butter and cook over moderately low heat, whisking constantly, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of the whisk.
 - Chill for at least an hour before using.
