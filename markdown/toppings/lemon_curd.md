## Recipe: Lemon Curd
This is the only lemon curd recipe, all others pale in comparison.  
Quantity: About 16 oz  

### Ingredients
 - 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (probably 2-3 lemons)
 - 2 tsp finely grated lemon zest
 - 1/2 cup sugar
 - 3 eggs
 - 6 tbsp unsalted butter

### Steps
 - In a saucepan, boil water. Place a heat-proof mixing bowl over the water, and whisk together lemon juice, zest, sugar, and eggs.
 - Stir in butter and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of the whisk and bubbles appear on the surface, about 6 minutes.
 - Chill for at least an hour before using.
