## Recipe: Molasses Jewelbox Cookies
How big is a square of chocolate? Who knows. This recipe was on a molasses jar in the 1970s and became a family tradition. So, my mom knows, but I'll have to wait until next Christmas to find out.

### Ingredients
 - 1 cup butter
 - 1 cup molasses
 - 2 cups light brown sugar, packed
