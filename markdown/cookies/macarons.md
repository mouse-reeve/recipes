## Recipe: Macarons


### Ingredients
 - 100 grams blanched almond meal
 - 180 grams powdered sugar (should contain corn starch)
 - 100 grams egg whites, aged for 24 hours
 - 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
 - 35 grams castor sugar or superfine sugar

### Steps
 - Trace circle templates on the back of two sheets of parchment paper as piping references, and place on baking sheets.
 - Finely grind the almond meal and powdered sugar in a food processor for a minute or two, and set aside.
 - Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy.
 - While beating the eggs, slowly add the castor sugar until it forms stiff peaks.
 - Sift the almond meal mixture into the meringue in three batches, gently folding it in. Don't skip the sifting, it's super important.
 - Pour the meringue into a piping bad with a 1/2 inch tip, and pipe evenly spaced circles on the prepared baking sheet.
 - Tap the baking sheets gently on each side to even out the macarons.
 - Wait 30 to 60 minutes until the top of the meringue is no longer tacky.
 - Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and bake for 14-16 minutes. The cookies should just begin to separate from the parchment paper.
 - Allow to cool completely, and then fill sandwiches with whatever makes you happy -- jam, swiss buttercream, lemon curd, caramel...
