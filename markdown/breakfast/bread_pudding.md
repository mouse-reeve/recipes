## Recipe: Bread pudding
I only had about half the heavy cream and used cream top milk for the rest. Should be 2 cups heavy cream, the weight may be wrong.  
Prep time: 15 minutes  
Total time: 1 hour  
Quantity: 5 individual cocottes  

### Ingredients
 - 490 g heavy cream
 - 170 g eggs (3 eggs)
 - 50 g granulated sugar
 - 10 g vanilla extract (2 tsp)
 - 150 g fermented blueberry puree
 - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
 - Zest of 1 lemon
 - 80 g frozen berries
 - 12 oz stale challah, cut into cubes
 - Sliced almonds for garnish

### Steps
 - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
 - Cream together all the ingredients except the frozen berries and challah.
 - Pour most of the custard over the cubes of bread, and allow to soak in for a few minutes, turning periodically to evenly soak the bread.
 - Toss in the berries.
 - Transfer the mixture to a greased baking pan, and pour the remaining custard over the top.
 - Cover and bake for 20 minutes, and then remove the cover and bake for another 10-20 minutes until set and juice does not seep out when you press gently on the top.
 - Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot. They also freeze well fully baked and re-heated in the oven.
