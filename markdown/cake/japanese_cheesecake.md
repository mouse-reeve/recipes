## Recipe: Japanese Cheesecake
This is a light, airy cheesecake quite unlike the dense, creamy New York kind.  
Prep time: 30 minutes  
Total time: 5 hours  
Quantity: An 8 inch cake  

### Ingredients
 - 5 large eggs, yolks and white separated
 - 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
 - 8 oz cream cheese
 - 1/2 cup whole milk
 - 1/4 cup butter at room temperature
 - 1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided
 - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
 - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
 - 2 tablespoons cornstarch

### Steps
 - Line the outside of an 8 inch springform pan with foil, to seal it from water.
 - Fill a large baking pan half way with water and place it in the oven.
 - Preheat the oven to 315 F
 - In a large bowl, beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy.
 - Add the cream of tartar, and increase the mixer to medium-high speed.
 - When the whites start to thicken, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar.
 - Beat until the egg whites have reached soft peaks, about 3 minutes.
 - In a separate bowl, mix together the cream cheese and milk at low speed until creamy and smooth
 - Add the butter, 1/4 cup of sugar, and lemon juice and beat for another minute.
 - Add the flour and corn starch and beat for another minute.
 - Add the egg yolks and beat for one last minute.
 - In three batches, gently fold the egg whites into the batter until just incorporated.
 - Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
 - Hold the sides of the pan and carefully drop it a short distance onto the counter to remove any large air bubbles.
 - Place the springform pan into the water bath and bake for 60-70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
 - Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes to brown the top.
 - Allow to cool in the oven with the door open for an hour.
 - Remove from pan and refrigerate for a couple hours until completely chilled.
 - Serve with a tart fruit sauce.
