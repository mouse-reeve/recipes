## Recipe: Cashew Whipped Cream
This is great on fruit, but has a present nutty flavor that has to be accounted for.  


### Ingredients
 - 1 cup almond milk
 - 1/2 cup refined coconut oil, melted
 - 1/4 cup cashews, soaked for 3-5 hours
 - 1/4 cup sugar
 - 1 tsp lecithin
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Steps
 - Blend all the ingredients until smooth.
 - Refrigerate for a few hours, until the cream is thick and can be spooned out
