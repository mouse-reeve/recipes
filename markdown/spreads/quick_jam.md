## Recipe: Quick Jam
Not proper preserves I guess.  


### Ingredients
 - 12 oz fruit, fresh or frozen
 - 1/4 sugar
 - 1 tbsp arrowroot
 - 2 tbsp water

### Steps
 - Combine the fruit and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat.
 - Bring to a boil and simmer for 10-20 minutes, until the fruit begins to break down.
 - Dissolve the arrowroot in the water and whisk it into the fruit mixture; it should thicken, but not be as thick as jam.
 - Wash jars in hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly.
 - Pour the jam, still hot, into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch of room at the top.
 - Refrigerate until use; keeps for 2-3 weeks.
