## Recipe: Olive Oil Pie Crust
This produces a savory, soft crust.  


### Ingredients
 - 2 1/2 cups flour
 - 3/4 tsp salt
 - 2/3 cup olive oil, partially frozen
 - 4 to 8 tbsps ice water
 - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

### Steps
 - Measure olive oil into a container and freeze for one hour. It should be congealed and opaque, but still somewhat soft.
 - In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour and salt. Working quickly, add the olive oil by the tablespoonful, cutting it into the flour with your fingers or a pastry cutter, until the flour appears pebbly.
 - In a cup mix together 4 tablespoons of the ice water with the apple cider vinegar. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of the water and vinegar mixture and using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula stir into the dough, adding more water a tablespoon at a time until it holds together to form a soft ball. Take care not to over-knead the dough.
 - Divide dough in two, press into each disk about an inch thick and place each piece between two 14 inch long pieces of waxed paper. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. For a more even, uniform circle of dough roll the pin one or two strokes outward away from you, turn the dough a few degrees and roll a few times again and repeat. Repeat with other half of dough. Refrigerate rolled dough wrapped in waxed paper until ready to use, or as directed in recipe.
