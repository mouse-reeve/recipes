## Recipe: Kabocha and Shallot Tartlettes
I played it by ear with this recipe, so the instructions are a bit hand-wavey.  
Quantity: 2 dozen  

### Ingredients
 - 1 kabocha squash
 - Olive or coconut oil
 - 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
 - 3-4 shallots, finely chopped
 - A few leafs of fresh sage, finely chopped
 - Some butter
 - 1 batch of pie crust
 - Grated parmesan cheese
 - 1 egg, optional, beaten with a little water
 - Sesame seeds

### Steps
 - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
 - Cut the kabocha in half and scoop out the seeds, then quarter it. Rub it with oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a little cinnamon.
 - Roast the squash for 30-40 minutes, until the flesh is creamy and soft.
 - Mash the squash with butter until it's as buttery as you want it to be.
 - Lightly toast the walnuts for 5-10 minutes.
 - Satuee the shallots and sage until caramelized.
 - Line a tartlette or cupcake pan with circles of pie crust, and press parmesan cheese into each tart.
 - Lower the oven temperature to 350 and blind bake the crusts for 10-ish minutes, until golden brown,
 - Assmeble the tarts: place a spoonful of shallots in the center of each cup, then cover with a ball of kabocha. Press walnuts around the edge, creating a border. Using a pastry brush, lighlty wash with beaten egg, if using, and sprinkle a little salt and sesame seeds over the top.
 - Bake again for 10 ish minutes.
