==========================


### Ingredients
- pasta:
    - 3/4 pound elbow macaroni (about 3 cups dry pasta)
    - 2 cups chickpeas, mashed
    - 1 tbsp olive oil
- cheeze:
    - 4 cups vegetable broth
    - 1/2 cup flour
    - 2 tbsp olive oil
    - 6 cloves garlic, minced
    - Large pinch dry thyme, crumbled
    - 1/4 tsp salt
    - Fresh ground black pepper
    - 1/4 tsp turmeric
    - 1 1/2 cups nutritional yeast
    - 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
    - 2 tsp prepared yellow mustard

### Steps
Cook pasta as instructed, about 10 minutes.

Make the sauce:
- Combine broth and flour and whisk until dissolved.
- Preheat a saucepan with 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium-low heat. Add garlic, and gently cook for about 2 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning.
- Add thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook for another few seconds
- Add broth, turmeric, and nutritional yeast, and raise the heat to medium
- Whisk constantly for about 5 minutes; the sauce should bubble and thicken.
- Add lemon juice and mustard. The mixture should resemble melty cheese.
- Add salt to taste.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F

Line the bottom of a 11 x 13-inch pan with chickpeas mashed together with 1 cup of cheeze sauce, and 1 tbsp olive oil.

Add the pasta to the sauce, and pour the mixture into the pan.

Bake for 30 minutes, until the top is lightly browned.

Cool for 20 minutes before serving
