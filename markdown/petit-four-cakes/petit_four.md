## Recipe: Petit Four

Quantity: 24 - 36 mini cakes  


### Ingredients
 - Cake sponge baked in a 17 1/2 x 12 1/2 x 1 pan
 - 1/2 cup filling
 - 1 batch (20oz) poured fondant
 - Decorations made of marzipan or rolled fondant

### Steps
 - Select a combination of sponge, filling, fondant flavoring, and decoration, and prepare all the components as directed.
 - Cut the sponge in thirds for three tier cakes, or half for two tier.
 - Spread the filling on all but the top layer cake.
 - Stack the iced layers of cake, and wrap in cellophane.
 - Press the layer cake under a heavy book or pan in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours, or overnight.
 - Cut the cake into desired shapes, and place on a wire rack on a clean rimmed baking sheet.
 - Warm the fondant in a double boiler to a thick but pourable consistency. Too warm, and it won't create a thick enough layer, and too cool, it won't run down the sides of the cakes.
 - Use a 1/4 cup measure to pour a generous layer of fondant, making sure that it covers the whole cake (check the back). Let the extra fondant pour through the colling rack and collect in the pan below.
 - Periodically scrape the runoff fondant out of the pan and add back to the double boiler.
 - Place decorations on the cakes as you go, just after they are iced.
 - Refrigerate or freeze cakes until ready to eat.
