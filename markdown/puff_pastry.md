## Recipe: Puff Pastry

Quantity: 24 croissants or puff pastry tarts  


### Ingredients
 - 4 cups flour, divided
 - 2 cups unsalted butter, 1/4 cup chilled and the rest at room temperature
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 1/4 cup cold water

### Steps
 - Measure all but 1/2 cup of flour into a mixing bowl.
 - Cut in the 1/4 cup of chilled butter with a pastry blender until it resembled course crumbs.
 - Add the salt and water and mix gently until a rough dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If necessary, add more water 1 tbsp at a time until the dough comes together.
 - Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes.
 - Form the dough into a 9 inch square, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
 - Place the remaining 1 3/4 cups butter and 1/2 cup flour in a food processor and blend together (or use a wooden spoon and blend by hand).
 - Form the butter into an 8 inch square on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper, cover it with a second sheet, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
 - Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it into a 12 inch square on a lightly floured surface.
 - Place the chilled butter in the center, and fold the corners of the dough over the butter until it meets in the middle. Seal the dough over the butter.
 - Turn the square over and gently roll it into a 20 by 10 inch rectangle. Make sure your surface is well dusted with flour.
 - Brush off any excess flour, and fold the dough into thirds.
 - If the dough is still cold, repeat the rolling and folding. If not, wrap it in plastic and chill it for 15 minutes and then proceed to the second turn.
 - Repeat the process of chilling and folding the dough until your have made six turns.
 - Refrigerate at least an hour before using.
 - To use, roll half the dough and trim the edges before forming as desired.
 - For croissants, bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes.
