# Garlic & Herb Vegan Cheese
This is more of a fancy hummus, but it's reaaaaally good.

## Ingredients

 - 2 cups raw cashews
 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
 - 1/2 tsp garlic powder, plus more to taste
 - 1 lemon worth of lemon zest
 - 2 lemons, juiced (about 1/4 cup lemon juice)
 - 3/4 water
 - 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
 - 1/2 tsp sea salt
 - 2 tbsp olive oil

## Steps

 - Soak the cashews in cool water for 12 hours in the refridgerator.
 - Drain the cashews and puree with the remaining ingredients.
 - Blend until very smooth, adding seasonings to taste.
 - Line a collander or seive with two layers of cheese cloth.
 - Pour the mixture into the cheese cloth, and pull the corners of the cloth up, and tie to create a snug package.
 - Refridgerate for 6-12 hours until set, and the cheese has drained off excess liquid.
 - Unwrap gently, and move the cheese to a esrving platter. Keep refridgerated.
