Quantity: 9 x 13 inch tray of fudge  

### Ingredients
 - 470 g and 135 g coconut cream (divided)
 - 670 g sugar
 - 75 g corn syrup
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tbsp vanilla extract
 - 16 oz semisweet chocolate
 - 85 g cocoa powder
 - 150 g chopped walnuts

### Steps
 - Toast the nuts for 20 minutes at 300 F.
 - Line a 9 x 13 pan with parchment paper.
 - Mix 470 grams coconut cream, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan, making sure not to get sugar on the sides of the pan, which can cause crystallization.
 - Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low.
 - Insert a candy thermometer and let the mixture reach 250 F.
 - Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl. Do not scrape the bottom of the pan, as there may be bitter or burnt sugar.
 - Whisk in the remaining 135 grams of coconut cream and vanilla extract.
 - Allow the mixture to cool to around 210 F, and beat in the chocolates with an electric mixer until smooth.
 - Fold in the nuts.
 - Press the fudge into the prepared dish, and allow to cool in the refrigerator for at least two hours before cutting.
