## Recipe: Seitan Chicken
I halve the volume and nearly double the seasoning from Miyoko's version.  
Quantity: 6 chicken "breasts"  

### Ingredients
 - 1/2 lb medium tofu
 - 1/2 cup water
 - 1/4 cup canola oil
 - 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
 - 1 1/2 tbsp onion powder
 - 3 tsp garlic powder
 - 2 tsp poultry seasoning
 - 1 1/2 tsp sea salt
 - 1 3/4 cups wheat gluten
 - Some olive oil, for cooking
 - 2 - 3 cups water
 - 1 tbsp soy sauce

### Steps
 - In a food processor, blend the tofu, water, oil, nutritional yeast, and seasonings until very smooth.
 - Add the gluten and blend until a ball forms in the center of the food processor.
 - Roll the dough into a log and cut into 6 pieces.
 - Shape the pieces into thin patties, and cook in a deep pan until browned on both sides.
 - Cover the patties with water and add the soy sauce.
 - Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.
