## Recipe: Biscuits
I recommend folding some chunks of Miyoko's Creamery "Rustic Alpine" vegan cheese into the dough at the turning stage, and grinding a little black pepper over the top of the biscuits before baking.  


### Ingredients
 - 1 cup almond milk
 - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
 - 2 cups flour
 - 1 tbsp baking powder
 - 1/2 tsp baking soda
 - 3/4 tsp sea salt
 - 1/4 cup vegan butter

### Steps
 - Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
 - Mix vinegar and almond milk in a measuring cup and leave to curdle.
 - In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients, and cut in cold butter.
 - Gently stir the almond milk into the mixture 1/4 cup at a time until just combined.
 - On a lightly floured surface, turn the dough 5 or 6 times.
 - Pat the dough into a 1 inch thick disc and cut biscuits out with a cookie cutter.
 - Push a small divot into the top of each biscuit, and brush some melted butter on top.
 - Bake for 10-15 minutes, until fluffy and golden brown.
