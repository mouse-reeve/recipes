## Recipe: Brown Irish Soda Bread
This is a rich, moist bread that is good fresh and toasts well the next day.  


### Ingredients
 - 2 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
 - 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
 - 3 tbsp granulated sugar
 - 1 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp baking soda
 - 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
 - 1/4 cup flax seeds
 - 1 3/4 cups buttermilk, at room temperature
 - 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
 - 1 tbsp salted butter, melted

### Steps
 - Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees F.
 - Whisk all-purpose flours, wheat germ, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and seeds together in large bowl.
 - Combine buttermilk and 2 tbsp melted unsalted butter in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.
 - Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until cohesive mass forms, about 8 turns.
 - Divide and pat dough into 2 rounds and transfer to a greased baking sheet. Using a sharp serrated knife, make a 1/2-inch deep cross about 5 inches long on top of the loaf.
