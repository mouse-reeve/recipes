## Recipe: Brown Irish Soda Bread (Vegan)


### Ingredients
 - 1 1/2 cups almond milk, at room temperature
 - 2 tsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice
 - 2 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1 1/2 cups wheat flour
 - 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
 - 3 tbsp sugar
 - 1 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp baking soda
 - 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
 - 1/4 cup flax seeds
 - 1/4 cup vegan butter, melted
 - 1 tbsp vegan butter, melted

### Steps
 - Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees F.
