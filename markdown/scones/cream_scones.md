## Recipe: Cream Scones
Prep time: 30 minutes  
Total time: 45 minutes  
Quantity: A dozen scones  

### Ingredients
 - 1 tablespoon golden flax meal
 - 2 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
 - 2 tsp baking powder
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/3 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 1/2 cup soy milk

### Steps
 - Preheat the oven to 375 F
 - In a small bowl, beat together the flax seed meal with two tablespoons of water, and set aside to rest.
 - In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
 - Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter into the four mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
 - In a measuring cup, whisk together the soy milk, vanilla, and flax mixture, which should have gotten viscous.
 - Fold the wet ingredients into the flour mixture until just combined. Do not over mix.
 - On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times, folding the dough over and turning it.
 - Roll the dough out to about 3/4 inch thick, and cut out circles with a floured biscuit cutter.
 - Arrange the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicon mat, and brush the tops of the scones with soy milk.
 - Bake for 15-18 minutes until golden brown.
