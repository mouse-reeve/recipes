## Recipe: Lemon Ginger Scones
For vegan scones, 1:1 substitute chilled refined coconut oil or vegan butter for dairy butter, and curdled almond milk for buttermilk.  


### Ingredients
 - 2/3 cup almond milk
 - 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
 - 2 cups all purpose flour
 - 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
 - 1 tsp baking powder
 - 1/4 tsp baking soda
 - 1/4 tsp salt
 - 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
 - 1/2 cup crystallized ginger, chopped into small pieces
 - 1 lemon's worth of lemon zest

### Steps
 - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place rack in the center of the oven.
 - Mix the milk and vinegar, and allow to curdle.
 - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
 - Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.
 - Stir in crystallized ginger and lemon zest.
 - Add curdled milk and mix just until the dough comes together. Do not over mix.
 - Transfer to a lightly floured surface and gently knead the dough four or five times and then pat the dough into a circle that is about 7 inches round and about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut this circle in half, then cut each half into 4 pie-shaped wedges (triangles). Place the scones on the baking sheet.
 - Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
