        "Combine the fruit and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat.",
        "Bring to a boil and simmer for 10-20 minutes, until the fruit begins to break down.",
        "Dissolve the arrowroot in the water and whisk it into the fruit mixture; it should thicken, but not be as thick as jam.",
        "Wash jars in hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly.",
        "Pour the jam, still hot, into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch of room at the top.",
        "Refrigerate until use; keeps for 2-3 weeks."
