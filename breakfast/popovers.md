Popovers
========

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus softened butter for greasing pans
- 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup milk, at room temperature

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Generously grease muffin tin with softened butter. You'll need enough pans to make 12 popovers.

Whisk together the flour, salt, eggs, milk, and melted butter until smooth. Let the batter rest for 10 minutes. 

Heat the muffin tin in the oven for 5 minutes. Divide the batter into the cups. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F. for another 20 minutes.
