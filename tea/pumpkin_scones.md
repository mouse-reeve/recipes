Pumpkin Scones
==============

For vegan scones, 1:1 substitute butter for chilled coconut oil, and buttermilk for almond milk.

- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/3 cup light or dark brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup canned pure pumpkin
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place rack in the center of the oven.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, spices, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.

In a separate bowl mix together the buttermilk, pumpkin puree and vanilla and then add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture. Mix just until the dough comes together. Do not over mix.

Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead dough gently four or five times and then pat the dough into a circle that is about 7 inches round and about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut this circle in half, then cut each half into 4 pie-shaped wedges (triangles). Place the scones on the baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash.

Place the baking sheet inside another baking sheet to prevent the bottoms of the scones from over browning. Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
